   <p>Reviews:<br>Great camera<img class ='price' src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/291/291201.svg" width="42" height="42"><br />
  <small>What else can you say about a camera that works for both of you .I make photographs at work and so wanted a camera good enough to compare with what i use professionally .At the same time i wanted my wife to not be intimidated by knobs and buttons .I recieved the camera inserted a larger compact flash_card charged the battery and handed it to my wife .I showed her how to turn it on where the lens zoom lever is and she loves it .This camera has canon 's great colorimetry plus what you see in the lcd is what you get .The prints are beautiful and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality .I tried out some other brands in the stores and was disappointed by the battery_life of the other company plus what you see in the lcd ( no optical finder ) is n't what you get not even for color the output was less than i expected .Although canon 's batteries are proprietary they last a really long time recharge fairly quickly in the camera plus if you want more power you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon . </small></p>

  <p>Upgraded from g2 and not looking back <img class ='price' src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/291/291201.svg" alt="Smiley face" width="42" height="42"><br />
  <small>The powershot g3 is a great camera .Why because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos .4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera .It 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .make sure you get a big compactflash_card ( it comes with a 32mb ) the 512mb cards are pretty [ inexpensive ] here on amazon.com and can hold about 500 photos at a time .</small></p>

    <p>Ok for a digital camera<img class ='price' src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/291/291202.svg" width="42" height="42"><br />
  <small>Maybe it is my lack of experience but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .It was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .Sure it had all the features but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wa n't up to the task .I do n't think i was asking too much .Any film zoom p and s would have given superior results with a minimal effort and with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera .I found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust .I wanted it to shoot concerts as well that meant even less light and just as much action .Sure i adjusted the film speed to 400 .The grain was terrible next time i set it at 100 and used the flash .Well flash photos are never great and there was still a lot of noise .When i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving the photos were awesome .The camera was a marvel getting the printer to help output them was another tale .Overall i think that you need to consider what you wa n't to do .for simple point and shoot photography consider a cheaper digital .You do n't need the extra resolution or the cost .Then again a one time_use_camera may do just as well .If you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality this will be your camera .It is versatile and seems to be one of the best .i am going with a leica minilux ( the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen ).Sure it is less versatile but i am never disappointed with the output .</small></p>

    <p>The catch <img class ='price' src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/291/291202.svg" width="42" height="42"><br />
  <small>The catch with the canon g3 camera ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .Prior to the purchase none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture .No one told me but i wanted to tell you .This is not the same thing as a film_camera and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs .They have n't got all the bugs worked out just yet .Most of the time my g3 is a well-behaved camera but once in a while i run up against it 's major flaw .It sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button .I am not talking milliseconds picture this .Your child is going to do a cannonball off the diving board so you compose the shot and wait for your moment .when it arrives you press the shutter release .splash .The moment passes and then your new g3 camera takes the shot .Perhaps there is a way around this delay .Some feature i could turn on or off or some attachment i could get .Yes i push the button down halfway first to avoid the autofocus delay .Yes i have red-eye off and yes i 've tried adding a flash but after trying many adjustments the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any film-based camera .I own another canon an eos ( 35mm film ) camera .It focuses in a snap dim or bright it would never take a picture after the birthday candles had blown out after the tae kwon do kick broke the board canon 's g3 does it consistently .It feels slow to focus and unbearably slow to shoot .I challenge anyone ( who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon ) to say it is fast and responsive and so i must ask what are cameras for what task do they perform .Cameras capture moments .They stop time .because once the moment is gone it is not coming back .the dive the kick the blow-out-the-candles moments are to me the reason for cameras .A 35mm film_camera captures the moments you want while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture .', 'not all the time but often enough to be a real problem .like i said when the moment is gone it is gone .So buy the g3 .buy it for fun for lack of processing because you want to use iphoto or whatever .but do not assume as i did that the g3 has the same ability as your current film camera ] to stop the moment you choose .', 'from a dime store disposable to a top of the line eos all film cameras share this ability to capture the moment you tell them to .', 'unfortunately this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted . </small></p>
